# ChimerMarker output parser

Takes the .xlxs export from ChimerMarker and parses it into a simplified table with the key information. 

This is done through the Extraction ID value found in the file. 

The basic table produced can then be uploaded into the FileMaker LIMS.

The "Master Workbook" must contain the word "workbook", and the other patient report files must have a dash "-" in them.
